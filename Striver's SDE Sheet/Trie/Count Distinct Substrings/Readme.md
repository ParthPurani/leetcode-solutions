You should implement the program using a trie.</h4>

<h5 id="note">Note :</h5>

<pre><code>A string ‘B’ is a substring of a string ‘A’ if ‘B’ that can be obtained by deletion of, several characters(possibly none) from the start of ‘A’ and several characters(possibly none) from the end of ‘A’. 

Two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are considered different if there is at least one index ‘i’  such that the character of ‘X’ at index ‘i’ is different from the character of ‘Y’ at index ‘i’(X[i]!=Y[i]).
</code></pre>

<h5 id="input-format">Input Format :</h5>

<pre><code>The first line contains a single integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

Then, the ‘T’ test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a string.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output Format :</h5>

<pre><code>For each test case, print an integer denoting the number of distinct substrings in the given string.

The output for each test case will be printed in a separate line.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="note">Note :</h5>

<pre><code>You don’t need to print anything, It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints :</h5>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 5
1 &lt;= |S| &lt;= 10^3

‘S’ contains only lowercase English letters.
