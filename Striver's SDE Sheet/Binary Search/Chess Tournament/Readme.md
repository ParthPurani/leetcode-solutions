<h5 id="for-example">For example,</h5>

<pre><code>let say we have 3 players and 5 rooms available and the rooms are at positions:  1 2 3 4 6
Here the optimal allocation is in rooms 1 3 6 and the overall focus level is 2.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="input-format">Input format :</h5>

<pre><code>The first line of input contains a single integer T, representing the number of test cases or queries to be run. 

Then the T test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two positive integers N and C, which represent the number of rooms in the hotel and the number of chess players.

The next line contains N space-separated positive integers representing the position of available room in the hotel.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output Format :</h5>

<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer, representing the maximum overall focus of the tournament.

Print the output of each test case in a separate line.

<h5 id="note">Note:</h5>

<pre><code>You do not need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraint">Constraint :</h5>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= T &lt;= 10
2 &lt;= N &lt;= 10 ^ 4
2 &lt;= C &lt;= N
1 &lt;= positions[i] &lt;= 10 ^ 9
