A spanning tree’s weight is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.</h4>

<h5 id="input-format">Input Format:</h5>

<pre><code>The first line contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases. Then each test case follows.

The first input line of each test case contains two integers ‘N’ and ‘M’ denoting the number of nodes and edges in the graph, respectively.

Each of the next ‘M’ lines contains three space integers ‘U’, ‘V’, and ‘W’. There is an undirected edge between node ‘U’ and ‘V’ of weight ‘W’.

<h5 id="output-format">Output Format:</h5>

<pre><code>For each test case, return the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the given graph.
