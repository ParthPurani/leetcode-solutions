Your task is to print all the strongly connected components (SCCs) present in the graph.</h4>

<h5 id="input-format">Input format:</h5>

<pre><code>The very first line of input contains an integer ‘T’ denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of every test case contains two space-separated integers ‘V’ and ‘E’ denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges present in the graph. 

The next ‘E’ lines contain two space-separated integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ denoting a directed edge from vertex ‘a’ to ‘b’.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="note">Note:</h5>

<pre><code>Use zero-based indexing for the vertices.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output format:</h5>

<pre><code>For each test case, print space-separated vertices present in the strongly connected components of the graph, print the output for one SCC on each line.

The order of sequence does not matter.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="note">Note:</h5>

<pre><code>You do not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints:</h5>

<pre><code>1 &lt;= 'T' &lt;= 300 
1 &lt;= 'V' &lt;= 2000
'V' - 1 &lt;= 'E' &lt;= 2000
0 &lt;= 'a, b' &lt; 'V'
